# PetFinder
Our web app has certain tasks. 
For example, users can upload a photo of the animal that they found (or for an adoption) and give some information
like gender, breed, appearance and information of identification tag if it has and details about them.
Also give location information. So that, people can find their lost animals more easily. 
Also, if the users want to adopt a pet or lost their pet, they choose some detailed information and location to the system.
Then, our app brings the matching animals for them.
PetFinder aims to encourage pets for adoption providing interactions with people.
